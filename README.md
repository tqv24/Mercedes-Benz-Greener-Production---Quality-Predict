# Mercedes-Benz Greener Manufacturing Prediction

## Overview
This project aims to address the challenge posed by Daimler in the Kaggle competition, "Mercedes-Benz Greener Manufacturing." The goal is to predict the testing time for different permutations of Mercedes-Benz car features, ultimately contributing to speedier testing and reduced carbon dioxide emissions.

## Project Structure
The repository is organized as follows:

- `data/`: Contains the input datasets, including `train.csv.zip` and `test.csv.zip`.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for data exploration, preprocessing, and model development.
  - `01_data_exploration.ipynb`: Exploration of the dataset.
  - `02_data_preprocessing.ipynb`: Data preprocessing steps.
  - `03_model_training.ipynb`: Model training using a Random Forest Regressor.
- `submission/`: Contains the final submission file (`submission.csv`) for the Kaggle competition.
- `README.md`: Documentation providing an overview of the project, dataset description, and usage instructions.

## Dependencies
- Python 3
- Required Python packages are listed in `requirements.txt`. Install them using:
